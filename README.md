Bank Client Churn Prediction This repository contains an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model implemented in Python using TensorFlow/Keras for the purpose of predicting whether a bank client will leave the bank or not.The model serves as a binary classifier, classifying clients into two categories: those likely to churn and those likely to stay with the bank.

Motivation
The primary motivation behind developing this model is to assist banks and financial institutions in identifying clients who are at risk of leaving their services. By accurately predicting churn, banks can proactively take measures to retain customers, such as offering personalized incentives or addressing underlying issues that may lead to attrition.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model comprises historical banking data, including client demographics, transactional information, and behavioral patterns. It includes features such as account balance, transaction frequency, tenure, and customer satisfaction metrics. The dataset is labeled with binary churn indicators, indicating whether a client has churned or not.

Model Architecture
The ANN model architecture consists of multiple fully connected layers with various activation functions, such as ReLU and sigmoid, for feature extraction and non-linearity. Batch normalization and dropout layers are incorporated to prevent overfitting and improve model generalization. The final layer utilizes a sigmoid activation function to output the probability of the client leaving the bank.

Training Process
The model is trained using a portion of the dataset, and its performance is evaluated using a separate validation set. During training, hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs are tuned to optimize model performance. Cross-validation techniques may be employed to ensure robustness and reliability of the model.

Evaluation Metrics
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. These metrics provide insights into the model's ability to correctly classify churners and non-churners, as well as its overall predictive power and discrimination capability.

Deployment
Once trained and validated, the model can be deployed in production environments within banking systems or customer relationship management (CRM) platforms. It can be integrated into existing workflows to automate churn prediction processes and enable timely interventions to retain valuable customers.

Usage
To use the model, simply load the trained weights into a TensorFlow/Keras environment and provide input features for prediction. The model will output the probability of the client leaving the bank, allowing for targeted retention strategies to be implemented based on individual customer profiles.
